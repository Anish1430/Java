Make a class named movies which has the properties as were given above.

Sample object batman1 of the class movies has the properties as listed below

Batman 1:
Name:Batman 1
Rating: 8
Money Collection: 200,000
Profit: 5000
Lead Actor: Rachel Gupta & Nikhil Chinapa
Lead Actress: Disha
Now make a function named propDisplay() inside this class, which displays the values of all the properties of the class movies such that each property is printed in a separate line.

Then assign the values to the object Batman1, Batman2, Batman3 as listed using the parameterized constructor.

Batman 1:
Name:Batman 1
Rating: 8
Money Collection: 200,000
Profit: 5000
Lead Actor: Rachel Gupta & Nikhil Chinapa
Lead Actress: Disha


Batman 2:
Name:Batman 2
Rating: 9
Money Collection: 500,000
Profit: 8000
Lead Actor: Rannvijay Singha & Prince Narula
Lead Actress: Neha Dhupia


Batman 3:
Name:Batman 3
Rating: 10
Money Collection: 700,000
Profit: 6000
Lead Actor: Rachel Gupta & Prince Narula
Lead Actress: Neha Dhupia
Then print these values using the propDisplay() method made inside the class.

Note: Display all the properties of the batman1 first, then display the properties of the batman2, then display the properties of the batman3 object.

Also you need to make sure that each property is printed in a separate line.
