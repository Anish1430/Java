You have to store the information about videos by making a class named “youtubeVideo”.

This class “youtubeVideo” should have the data-members:

song: Stores the value (String Data-type)
artist: Stores the value  (String Data-Type), 
views: Stores the value (int Data-Type),
likes: Stores the values number of likes (int data-type), 
releasedYear: Stores the value (int Data-Type)
n: stores the size of arraylist named comments (int data-type)
comments: This is an arraylist which stores the Strings
Now make an object of the class youtubeVideo.

Now make a parametrised constructor which takes the value of the constructor in the order mentioned below.

song: 
artist: 
views: 
likes:  
releasedYear: 
n:
comments: 
Then take the below values of this object using the scanner in the order mentioned

song: 
artist: 
views: 
likes:  
releasedYear: 
n:
comments: 

Note that: Each string in the comments array can be made of more than one word.
Then print all the values of the object, such that each value of an object is printed in one line.

Note that: Each string in the comments arraylist should be printed in a separate        line. And all the words in a string should be printed in the same line.
