Make a class named movies which has the properties as were given above.

Sample object batman1 of the class movies has the properties as listed below

batman1
Name:Batman 1
Rating: 8
Money Collection: 200,000
Profit: 5000
Lead Actor: Rachel Gupta & Nikhil Chinapa
Lead Actress: Disha
All the properties listed above are public.

Now inside this class make two private properties views and likes.

Now make a public method named displayViews, which prints the views of the object.

Now make a public method named displayLikes, which prints the likes of the object.

Now make an object superman1 and assign it the properties upon initialisation

Superman 1
Name: Superman 1
Rating: 8
Money Collection: 90000
Profit: 1000
Lead Actor: Rachel Gupta and Prince Narula
Lead Actress: Aarushi
Views:10000

Make a new private method named calculateGrade which takes in views and likes as parameters.

It calculates the value of finalGrade using the formula,
finalGrade=10*likes + views,
Now this function returns the finalGrade value.

Then, make a public method named printGrade which calls the method calculateGrade, and then prints the value finalGrade that is returned by calculateGrade.

So now call the method printGrade for the superman1 object using the dot operator.
