Make a class named youtubeVideo which has the public properties as are listed down

song: Stores the value (String Data-type)
artist: Stores the value  (String Data-Type), 
views: Stores the value (int Data-Type),
likes: Stores the values number of likes (int data-type), 
releasedYear: Stores the value (int Data-Type)
n: stores the size of arraylist named comments (int data-type)
comments: This is an arraylist which stores the Strings
and this class also has private property named impression which stores int-data type values.

This class also has a getImpressions() public method which prints the impressions value in a separate line.

This class also has a calculateRank() named private method which returns the rank of the video.

Rank is 1 if sum of likes and impressions is more than 10000, Rank is 2 if sum of likes and impressions is more than 5000, Rank is 3 if the sum of likes and impressions is more than 1000. Rank is 4 if the total number of likes is 0.

This class also has a public method printRank() which calls the calculateRank() method of the class and prints the final rank in a separate line.

Now make an object of the class youtubeVideo.

Then take the below values of this object using the scanner in the order mentioned

song: 
artist: 
views: 
likes:  
releasedYear: 
n:
comments: 
impressions:

Note that: Each string in the comments array can be made of more than one word.
In the end first call the object getImpressions() and then call the method printRank() for this object.

Input Format

Take the input as mentioned above.

Constraints

Constraints are according to the data-type of the properties.
