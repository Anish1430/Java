batman1
Name:Batman 1
Rating: 8
Money Collection: 200,000
Profit: 5000
Lead Actor: John

Then make a constructor which takes in only two parameters: rating and money. Inside this constructor also write the code System.out.println(“Stored rating and money”);

Make another constructor which takes in three parameters: rating, money and profit. Inside this constructor also write the code System.out.println(“Stored rating, money, profit are given.”);

Make another constructor which takes in four parameters: rating, money and profit, lead actor name. Inside this constructor also write the code System.out.println(“Stored rating, money, profit, lead actors are given.”);

Now make an object named Superman1 and give it the parameters 8, 900000.

Now make an object named Superman2 and give it the parameters 8, 900000,8000.

Now make an object named Superman3 and give it the parameters 8, 900000,8000, “Ranveer Singh”.
