batman1
Name:Batman 1
Rating: 8
Money Collection: 200,000

Lead Actress: Disha
All the properties listed above are public.

Inside this make a method named displayRating() which prints the value of instance variable rating in the first line.

And in the second line it prints “This is the function of movies class.”

Now make a new class named commercialMovies which inherits the properties of movies class.

Also make a method named displayRating() inside the commercialMovies class, which prints the value of instance variable rating in the first line. And in the second line it prints “This is the function of the commercial movies class.”

Now make an object named londonDreams of the class commercialMovies. And assign the values as listed below to this object upon initialization.

Name: London Dreams

Money Collection: 9000000
Profit: 70000000
Lead Actor: “Salman Khan”
Lead Actress:”Asin”
Views:10000

Now, you have to make a new class named creativeMovies which inherits the class movies.

Inside this creativeMovies class, make a method named displayRating() which prints the rating of the object in the first line and prints the line “Inside the creativeMovies class” in the next line.

Also, make another object named andhadhun of the class creativeMovies. And assign the values as listed below of this object upon initialization.

Money Collection: 7000000
