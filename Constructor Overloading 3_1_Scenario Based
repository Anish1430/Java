You have to store the information about videos by making a class named “youtubeVideo”.

This class “youtubeVideo” should have the data-members:

song: Stores the value (String Data-type)
artist: Stores the value  (String Data-Type), 
views: Stores the value (int Data-Type),
likes: Stores the values number of likes (int data-type), 
releasedYear: Stores the value (int Data-Type)
n: stores the size of arraylist named comments (int data-type)
comments: This is an arraylist which stores the Strings
Now make a parametrized constructor inside this class which takes in four parameters in the order given:

song, artist, views, likes
This constructor sets the values of the properties as given and also prints the line “The song has just released”
Now make a parametrized constructor inside this class which takes in four parameters in the order given:

song, artist, views, likes, releasedYear

This constructor sets the values of the properties as given and also prints the line “The song was released in ” +  releasedYear
Then take the below values of the variables mentioned below using the scanner(in the order mentioned)

song: 
artist: 
views: 
likes:  
releasedYear: 
n:
comments: 
Now take another integer value and store it inside the variable k,

and if this value is 1, then use the first parametrised constructor to make the object of the class youtubeVideo

and if the value of k is 2, then use the second parametrised constructor to make the object of the class youtubeVideo.

Input Format

Take the input as mentioned above.

Constraints

Constraints are according to the data-type of the properties.
