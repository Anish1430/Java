You have to store the information about videos by making a class named “youtubeVideo”.

This class “youtubeVideo” should have the data-members:

song: Stores the value (String Data-type)
artist: Stores the value  (String Data-Type), 
views: Stores the value (int Data-Type),
likes: Stores the values number of likes (int data-type), 
releasedYear: Stores the value (int Data-Type)
n: stores the size of arraylist named comments (int data-type)
comments: This is an arraylist which stores the Strings
Now make a method add(x) which increments the count of views of the object by x and also prints the line "Views are added" and prints the count of views in the next lines and count of likes of the object in the next succeeding line.

Now make a method add(x, y) which increments the count of views and likes of the object by x and y respectively and also prints the line "Views and likes are added" and then prints the count of views in the next line and count of likes of the object in the next succeeding line.

Now make an object of the class youtubeVideo.

Then take the below values of this object using the scanner in the order mentioned

song: 
artist: 
views: 
likes:  
releasedYear: 
n:
comments: 

Note that: Each string in the comments array can be made of more than one word.
Now take an integer value and store it inside the variable k,

And if the value of k is 1, then call the method add(x) for this new object, and if the value of k is 2, then call the method add(x,y) for this new object.
